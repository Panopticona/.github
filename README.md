# Panopticona

## Overview

`Panopticona` is the Red Team's answer to a traditional Security Operations Center, designed for the era of ubiquitous cyber threats. Drawing inspiration from the concept of the panopticon—a theoretical prison designed for maximum observation—`Panopticona` positions users to monitor and analyze the digital landscape with unparalleled insight. This project aims to break the chains of conventional cybersecurity measures, much like liberating entities from a hacker's panopticon.

### Mission

Our mission is to empower organizations, governments, and security professionals by providing advanced tools for offensive cybersecurity operations. `Panopticona` stands as a bastion against the increasingly sophisticated digital threats that businesses, governments, and individuals face.

### Features

#### Modular Offensive Operations Center

- **Internet Observatory**: A multi-node, scalable system offering deep insights into target infrastructures, akin to services like Shodan and Censys, but with our innovative touch.
  
- **Command & Control (WIP)**: A centralized command interface for orchestrating complex offensive cybersecurity operations.

#### Data Empowerment

We embrace a "Data Grindset," advocating for proactive, intelligent data utilization. Beyond mere collection, `Panopticona` analyzes and leverages data to enhance knowledge and operational effectiveness against future cyber threats.

## Key Components

### Modern Internet Observatory

Our vision for an Internet Observatory is to deliver:
- Multi-node capabilities and high modularity.
- Enhanced AI insights and search functionalities.
- API-centric design for seamless integration.
- Advanced vulnerability scanning with tools from Project Discovery.

### Panopticona Architecture

With a focus on modularity and scalability, our architecture comprises microservices, utilizing Rust, Go, and Python to maximize performance, reliability, and ease of use across different components.

#### Core Nodes

- **Database Node**: The heart of data storage and retrieval, built with Rust for efficiency and security.
- **Observer Node**: Powers our scanning operations, leveraging Go for its superior concurrency and network performance.

#### Additional Highlights

- **AI Insights Engine**: Transforms raw data into actionable intelligence.
- **API Gateway**: Facilitates secure, scalable, and efficient external integrations.
